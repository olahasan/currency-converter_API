## what-i-learned

### API Integration
- **Fetching Data**: I learned how to fetch data from an external API using the `fetch` function in JavaScript.
- **Handling Responses**: I gained experience in handling JSON responses and dynamically updating the DOM based on the data received.

### JavaScript
- **Event Handling**: I improved my skills in adding event listeners and handling user interactions, such as button clicks and keypress events.
- **Modular Code**: I learned the importance of breaking down code into smaller, reusable functions for better readability and maintainability.

### CSS
- **Responsive Design**: I practiced creating responsive layouts using CSS, ensuring the application looks good on different screen sizes.
- **Styling**: I enhanced my understanding of CSS variables and how to use them for consistent styling across the application.

### HTML
- **Semantic HTML**: I learned the importance of using semantic HTML elements to improve the structure and accessibility of the web page.
- **Form Elements**: I gained experience in working with form elements, such as input fields and datalists, to create a user-friendly interface.

### Error Handling
- I learned how to implement error handling to provide better user feedback and improve the robustness of the application.

###### Overall, this project has helped me strengthen my front-end development skills and provided a solid foundation for future projects involving API integration and dynamic content.


## Continued Development
there are several areas where I plan to continue developing and enhancing the project:
- **Multiple Currencies**: Enable conversions between any two currencies, not just from USD to another currency.
- **Graphical Representation**: Add charts and graphs to visually represent exchange rate trends and conversion results.
- **Hosting**: Deploy the application on a web hosting platform to make it accessible to a wider audience.
